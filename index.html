          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            ABSENCE &#8212; in its 20th year of publication by Penn State Greater Allegheny &#8212;
            is an annual review of the best literary and visual art made by students,
      	    staff, faculty, and alums of the campus each academic year. ABSENCE is
      	    published each April, and is available for the first time in paper at an
      	    annual "Celebration of the Arts: A Reading and Reception," which features
      	    the creative work of each year's authors and artists. Acceptance for
      	    publication by the student editors is selective and competetive, holding
      	    at a rate of 20 to 25% since 2006.
          </p>
      	  <p>
      	    Student editors have the opportunity to earn as many as 8 hours of Penn
      	    State academic credit while working to produce ABSENCE by enrolling in
      	    English 209: Journal or Magazine Practicum (offered during the Fall or
      	    Spring semester).
          </p>
      	  <p>
      	    Yearly publication of ABSENCE is sponsored by the Office of the
      	    Chancellor, Academic Affairs, Admissions and Enrollment Management,
      	    Development, the Student Activity Fee, Student Affairs, and by individual
      	    faculty and staff contributions.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            The Mission of ABSENCE is the annual publication of a high-quality
	    literary and visual arts review for the Penn State Greater Allegheny
	    community. The review's goal is to provide all full- and part-time
	    PSUGA students, faculty, staff, and alumni a shared venue for their
	    creative endeavors, and to generate interest in the arts in the Greater
	    Allegheny community. The review also provides students professional
	    opportunities to prepare for careers as editors in publishing-whether
	    academic or trade, journal or book, paper or Web-and document/graphic
	    design. Past staff editors have gone on to work in publishing or on to
	    various graduate/professional studies.
