	  <h2>Submissions Guidelines</h2>
	  <p>
	    Eligibility for publication in ABSENCE is open to all full- and part-time students, faculty, staff, and
	    alumni of Penn State Greater Allegheny. Original poetry, fiction, non-fiction and creative non-fiction,
	    visual arts, and photography will be accepted for consideration by the student editors. Previously published
	    works will not be considered. Upon publication, all rights revert to authors/artists; however, ABSENCE reserves
	    the right to republish all materials electronically and to use materials published in the Review to fund its
	    publication. A blind-review process is employed to ensure that all submissions are judged solely on artistic
	    merit. A maximum of 10 submissions per volume can be made to the Senior Faculty Adviser, who removes all
	    biographical information before turning them over to the student editorial staff for consideration.
	  <p>
	    Preferred means of submission is by email attachment; send to: ABSENCE.psuga@gmail.com.
	  <p>
	    Final publication prerogative rests solely with the Editor.
